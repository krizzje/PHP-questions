How about a nice game of chess:

Given:
- a chessboard has N by N possible places where N >= 8
- a Queen can move an arbitrary amount of steps in all directions, until stopped by the chessboard boundary or another queen
- a Knight can move in all directions in an L shape fashion ( 2up/down 1left/right or 2left/right 1 up/down)

Assignment 1/2:
- Write a PHP program which outputs all possible placements of exactly N Queens on the chessboard in 
  such a way they don't "check" each other. BEWARE! If a placement _only differs from another by 
  rotation or reflection of the board_, it isn't considered a different possibility

- Write a PHP similar php algorithm which does the same for the maximum possible amount of Knight pieces, only 
  this time it also needs te determine on it's own how many Knight pieces can be ultimately placed on 
  the NxN sized board, without "checking" each other

Requirement:
- N needs to be an integer which needs to be entered at runtime.
- When outputting (on screen or to a browser), please make sure output is nicely & human readable formatted

Best of luck!
